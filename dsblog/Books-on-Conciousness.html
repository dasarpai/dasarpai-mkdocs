you are from the software industry and especially in a data scientist role on day to day basis. Then there are high chances you ask questions like </p> <p>What is life? <br> What is consciousness? <br> What is the reality of existence? <br> What is the final definition of God? <br> What is the ultimate reality of this world? </p> <p>I am not saying you ask these questions because you are fed up or puzzled with your life. But because of different reasons. You are creating artificial intelligence systems. </p> <p>In my own way, I have been reading, listening, contemplating, and meditating on the above questions. Adi Sankar's Advaita Vedanta speaks a volume on this subject. But in the last 100 years, many western philosophers and scientists started researching and writing on this subject. Apart from your professional life where you are paid for your work. Apart from the day to day family and social responsibilities if you are serious and get some time to reflect on the above questions then a list of the following books may be of your interest. </p> <p>Note: I am not saying other professionals don't ask these questions. When life goes through different circumstances everyone at one point or another goes through these questions. But, a serious software engineer who writes software (intelligence) for the hardware (body) has a high probability of thinking about these questions. </p> <h1 id=100-good-books-on-consciousness>100+ Good Books on Consciousness<a class=headerlink href=#100-good-books-on-consciousness title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1> <h2 id=1-the-principles-of-psychology>1.

Most of what "I" really am and what "I" actually do wells up from far below the surface. Jung is one of the great explorers of the dark but sovereign subconscious. You’ll bump into his archetypes if you dream diligently, fast long enough, or sit down in a winter wood and stare into the middle distance.</p> <h2 id=3-the-origins-and-history-of-consciousness>3.

The Doors of Perception<a class=headerlink href=#4-the-doors-of-perception title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Aldous Huxley, 1954</p> <p>Based on his experiences of taking the hallucinogen mescaline. Huxley concluded that the brain acted like a reducing valve, slowing down the influx of data into our brains to a manageable dribble. We may be drawing conclusions about the universe on the basis of a tiny fraction of the available information. We might be misreading it radically. It has recently been shown that human neural networks can process 11 dimensions. We usually use only four. We’re wired up for much, much more reality than we think.</p> <h2 id=5-be-here-now>5. Be Here Now<a class=headerlink href=#5-be-here-now title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Ram Dass, 1971</p> <p>Guru Ram Dass tells the story of his spiritual awakening and gives you the tools to take control of your life in this "counterculture bible" (The New York Times) featuring powerful guidance on yoga, meditation, and finding your true self. In 1960s author was known as Professor Richard Alpert. He held appointments in four departments at Harvard University. He published books, drove a Mercedes and regularly vacationed in the Caribbean. By most societal standards, he had achieved great success. . . . And yet he couldn’t escape the feeling that something was missing. Psilocybin and LSD changed that. During a period of experimentation, Alpert peeled away each layer of his identity, disassociating from himself as a professor, a social cosmopolite, and lastly, as a physical being. Fear turned into exaltation upon the realization that at his truest, he was just his inner-self: a luminous being that he could trust indefinitely and love infinitely. Thus, a spiritual journey commenced. Alpert headed to India where his guru renamed him Baba Ram Dass—"servant of God." He was introduced to mindful breathing exercises, hatha yoga, and Eastern philosophy. If he found himself reminiscing or planning, he was reminded to "Be Here Now." He started upon the path of enlightenment, and has been journeying along it ever since. Be Here Now is a vehicle for sharing the true message, and a guide to self-determination.</p> <h2 id=6-the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind>6.

Exploring the origin of human conflict and what we can do about the barriers that stand in the way of insight and consciousness, now revised and updated with a new introduction and added dialogues.</p> <p><strong>The Ending of Time</strong> is a series of important and enlightening dialogues in which Jiddu Krishnamurti and Dr. David Bohm. Dr David is a men from vastly different backgrounds in philosophy and physics, respectively—debate profound existential questions that illuminate the fundamental nature of existence, probing topics such as insight, illusion, awakening, transcendence, renewal, morality, the temporal, and the spiritual. Along the way, Krishnamurti and Bohm explore a person’s relationship to society and offer new insights on human thought, death, awakening, self realization, and the problem of the fragmented mind.</p> <p>The Ending of Time also refers to the wrong turn humanity has taken (a state that they argue can be corrected). Though they insist that mankind can change fundamentally, they warn that transformation requires going from one’s narrow and particular interests toward the general, and ultimately moving still deeper into that purity of compassion, love and intelligence that originates beyond thought, time, and even emptiness.</p> <p>This updated edition, edited and revised in clear and engaging language, includes a new introduction and a conversation previously published separately which examines “The Future of Humanity.”</p> <h2 id=9-nine-headed-dragon-river>9.

A wide-ranging investigation of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos theory in the dynamics of human creation, and the rediscovery of traditional wisdom.</p> <p>In this book of "trialogues," the late psychedelic visionary and shamanologist Terence McKenna, acclaimed biologist and originator of the morphogenetic fields theory Rupert Sheldrake, and mathematician and chaos theory scientist Ralph Abraham explore the relationships between chaos and creativity and their connection to cosmic consciousness. Their observations call into question our current views of reality, morality, and the nature of life in the universe. The authors challenge the reader to the deepest levels of thought with wide-ranging investigations of the ecology of inner and outer space, the role of chaos in the dynamics of human creation, and the resacralization of the world. Among the provocative questions the authors raise are: Is Armageddon a self-fulfilling prophecy? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined? Are the eternal laws of nature still evolving? What is the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness? Part ceremony, part old-fashioned intellectual discussion, these trialogues are an invitation to a new understanding of what Jean Houston calls "the dreamscapes of our everyday waking life."</p> <h2 id=23-the-illusion-of-conscious-will>23.

Irreducible Mind<a class=headerlink href=#28-irreducible-mind title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Bruce Greyson, 2006</p> <p>Current mainstream opinion in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind holds that all aspects of human mind and consciousness are generated by physical processes occurring in brains. Views of this sort have dominated recent scholarly publication. The present volume, however, demonstrates empirically that this reductive materialism is not only incomplete but false. The authors systematically marshal evidence for a variety of psychological phenomena that are extremely difficult, and in some cases clearly impossible, to account for in conventional physicalist terms.</p> <p>Topics addressed include phenomena of extreme psychophysical influence, memory, psychological automatisms and secondary personality, near-death experiences and allied phenomena, genius-level creativity, and 'mystical' states of consciousness both spontaneous and drug-induced. The authors further show that these rogue phenomena are more readily accommodated by an alternative 'transmission' or 'filter' theory of mind/brain relations advanced over a century ago by a largely forgotten genius, F. W. H. Myers, and developed further by his friend and colleague William James. This theory, moreover, ratifies the commonsense conception of human beings as causally effective conscious agents, and is fully compatible with leading-edge physics and neuroscience. The book should command the attention of all open-minded persons concerned with the still-unsolved mysteries of the mind.</p> <h2 id=29-philosophy-of-mind>29.

Seeking Wisdom is the result of Bevelin's learning about attaining wisdom. His quest for wisdom originated partly from making mistakes himself and observing those of others but also from the philosophy of super-investor and Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman <strong>Charles Munger</strong>. A man whose simplicity and clarity of thought was unequal to anything Bevelin had seen.</p> <p>In addition to naturalist Charles Darwin and Munger, Bevelin cites an encyclopedic range of thinkers: from first-century BCE Roman poet <strong>Publius Terentius</strong> to <strong>Mark Twain</strong>, from <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> to <strong>Richard Feynman</strong>, from 16<sup>th</sup> Century French essayist <strong>Michel de Montaigne</strong> to Berkshire Hathaway Chairman <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>. In the book, he describes ideas and research findings from many different fields. This book is for those who love the constant search for knowledge. It is in the spirit of Charles Munger, who says, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." There are roads that lead to unhappiness. An understanding of how and why we can "die" should help us avoid them. We can't eliminate mistakes, but we can prevent those that can really hurt us. Using exemplars of clear thinking and attained wisdom, Bevelin focuses on how our thoughts are influenced, why we make misjudgments and tools to improve our thinking. Bevelin tackles such eternal questions as: Why do we behave like we do? What do we want out of life? What interferes with our goals? Read and study this wonderful multidisciplinary exploration of wisdom. It may change the way you think and act in business and in life.</p> <h2 id=31-i-am-a-strange-loop>31.

How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science?</p> <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions. Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.</p> <h2 id=35-the-ego-tunnel>35.

The fact that psychic abilities are stronger among <strong>prodigies, autistic savants</strong>, and some people who are <strong>bipolar</strong> or have suffered certain <strong>brain injuries</strong> has led to brain-imaging and other research that can explain which parts of the brain are dominant in psychics and mystics.

A spiritual way of living by and from the heart that is inclusive of all ideologies, beliefs, and religions. In this heart-centered book, a student in conversation with his teacher, Kamlesh D. Patel—affectionately known as Daaji, the fourth and current spiritual guide of the century-old Heartfulness tradition—present a unique method of meditation with the power to facilitate an immediate, tangible spiritual experience, irrespective of a person’s faith. Our modern, fast-paced world can be an overwhelming place. Every day, we’re bombarded with messages telling us that in order to be happy, fulfilled, and worthy, we must be better, do more, and accumulate as much material wealth as possible. Most of us move through our busy lives with our minds full of these ideas, multitasking as we strive to navigate the responsibilities and expectations we must meet just to make it through the day. But what if there is another way? What if, rather than letting the busyness of life overtake our minds, we learn to be heartful instead?Based on Daaji’s own combination of approaches and practices for the modern seeker—which draws from the teachings of Sahaj Marg, meaning "Natural Path"—Heartfulness is a contemporized version of the ancient Indian practice of Raja Yoga, a tradition that enables the practitioner to realize the higher Self within. While many books describe refined states of being, The Heartfulness Way goes further, providing a pragmatic course to experience those states for oneself, which, per the book’s guiding principle, is "greater than knowledge."Heartfulness meditation consists of four elements—relaxation, meditation, cleaning, and prayer—and illuminates the ancient, defining feature of yogic transmission (or pranahuti), the utilization of divine energy for spiritual growth and transformation. Using the method, detailed practices, tips, and practical philosophy offered in this book, you’ll reach new levels of attainment and learn to live a life more deeply connected to the values of the Heartfulness way—with acceptance, humility, compassion, empathy, and love.</p> <h2 id=56-the-manual-a-philosophers-guide-to-life>56.

Becoming Supernatural marries some of the most profound scientific information with ancient wisdom to show how people like you and me can experience a more mystical life.</p> <p>Readers will learn that we are, quite literally supernatural by nature if given the proper knowledge and instruction, and when we learn how to apply that information through various meditations, we should experience a greater expression of our creative abilities; that we have the capacity to tune in to frequencies beyond our material world and receive more orderly coherent streams of consciousness and energy; that we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical transcendental experiences; and how, if we do this enough times, we can develop the skill of creating a more efficient, balanced, healthy body, a more unlimited mind, and greater access to the realms of spiritual truth. Topics include: Demystifying the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance them to heal? How to free yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a new mind? How you can create reality in the generous present moment by changing your energy? The difference between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension creation?

During extraordinary moments of consciousness—shock, meditative states and sudden mystical revelations, out-of-body experiences, or drug intoxication—our senses of time and self are altered; we may even feel time and self dissolving. These experiences have long been ignored by mainstream science, or considered crazy fantasies. Recent research, however, has located the neural underpinnings of these altered states of mind.</p> <p>In this book, neuropsychologist Marc Wittmann shows how experiences that disturb or widen our everyday understanding of the self can help solve the mystery of consciousness. Wittmann explains that the relationship between consciousness of time and consciousness of self is close; in extreme circumstances, the experiences of space and self intensify and weaken together. He considers the emergence of the self in waking life and dreams; how our sense of time is distorted by extreme situations ranging from terror to mystical enlightenment; the experience of the moment; and the loss of time and self in such disorders as depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Dostoyevsky reported godly bliss during epileptic seizures; neurologists are now investigating the phenomenon of the epileptic aura. Wittmann describes new studies of psychedelics that show how the brain builds consciousness of self and time, and discusses pilot programs that use hallucinogens to treat severe depression, anxiety, and addiction.If we want to understand our consciousness, our subjectivity, Wittmann argues, we must not be afraid to break new ground. Studying altered states of consciousness leads us directly to the heart of the matter: time and self, the foundations of consciousness.</p> <h2 id=61-stealing-fire>61.

Over the past decade, Silicon Valley executives like Eric Schmidt and Elon Musk, Special Operators like the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets, and maverick scientists like Sasha Shulgin and Amy Cuddy have turned everything we thought we knew about high performance upside down. Instead of grit, better habits, or 10,000 hours, these trailblazers have found a surprising short cut.</p> <p>They're harnessing rare and controversial states of consciousness to solve critical challenges and outperform the competition. New York Times bestselling author Steven Kotler and high performance expert Jamie Wheal spent four years investigating the leading edges of this revolution, from the home of SEAL Team Six to the Googleplex, the Burning Man festival, Richard Branson’s Necker Island, Red Bull’s training center, Nike’s innovation team, and the United Nations’ Headquarters. And what they learned was stunning: In their own ways, with differing languages, techniques, and applications, every one of these groups has been quietly seeking the same thing: the boost in information and inspiration that altered states provide. Today, this revolution is spreading to the mainstream, fueling a trillion dollar underground economy and forcing us to rethink how we can all lead richer, more productive, more satisfying lives.

Quantum Revelation<a class=headerlink href=#62-quantum-revelation title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><strong>A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality</strong> <br> Paul Levy, Jean Houston, 2018</p> <p>The Quantum Revelation is mind-blowing. To say that quantum physics is the greatest scientific discovery of all time is not an exaggeration. In their discovery of the quantum realm, the physics community stumbled upon a genuine multifaceted revelation which can be likened to a profound spiritual treasure. A heretofore undreamed of creative power―hidden within our own mind. Quantum physics unequivocally points out that the study of the universe and the study of consciousness are inseparably linked, which is to say that ultimate progress in the one will be impossible without progress in the other.</p> <p>Einstein declared that what it reveals is so immensely important that "it should be everyone’s concern." Yet few of us in the general public truly understand how the game-changing discoveries of the past century not only relate to our day-to-day lives, but also give us insights into the nature of reality and our place within it. Written for readers with no physics background, Paul Levy’s latest book, The Quantum Revelation: A Radical Synthesis of Science and Spirituality is for those who have heard that quantum physics is a fascinating subject but don’t quite understand how or why. Levy contemplates the deeper philosophical underpinnings of quantum physics, exploring the fundamental questions it provokes: What does it mean that quantum theory has discovered that <strong>there is no such thing as "objective reality?"</strong> How are we participating, via our consciousness, in creating our experience of a reality that quantum theory itself describes as "dreamlike?" What are the implications for us in our day-to-day lives that what we call reality is more like a dream that we had previously imagined? The Quantum Revelation is unique in how it synthesizes science and spirituality so as to reveal and explore the dreamlike nature of reality. It is a book not just for people interested in quantum theory, but for anyone who is interested in waking up and dreaming lucidly, be it in our night dreams or our waking life.</p> <h2 id=63-thus-spoke-the-plant>63.

In this "phytobiography"--a collection of stories written in partnership with a plant, researcher reveals the dynamic role plants play in genuine first-hand accounts from her research into plant communication and cognition.</p> <p>By transcending the view of plants as the objects of scientific materialism, Gagliano encourages us to rethink plants as people, beings with subjectivity, consciousness, and volition, and hence having the capacity for their own perspectives and voices. The book draws on up-close-and-personal encounters with the plants themselves, as well as plant shamans, indigenous elders, and mystics from around the world and integrates these experiences with an incredible research journey and the groundbreaking scientific discoveries that emerged from it. Gagliano has published numerous peer-reviewed scientific papers on how plants have a Pavlov-like response to stimuli and can learn, remember, and communicate to neighboring plants. She has pioneered the brand-new research field of plant bioacoustics, for the first time experimentally demonstrating that plants emit their own 'voices' and, moreover, detect and respond to the sounds of their environments. By demonstrating experimentally that learning is not the exclusive province of animals, Gagliano has re-ignited the discourse on plant subjectivity and ethical and legal standing. This is the story of how she made those discoveries and how the plants helped her along the way.</p> <h2 id=64-the-evolving-self-a-psychology-for-the-third-millennium>64.

Spiritual Science<a class=headerlink href=#80-spiritual-science title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><strong>Why Science Needs Spirituality to Make Sense of the World</strong> <br> Steve Taylor, 2019</p> <p>Spiritual Science offers an alternative, spiritual view of reality that transcends both conventional science and religion, and answers many of the riddles that neither can explain. The standard model of science has had little success in explaining such areas as human consciousness, the connection between the mind and the body, altruism and 'anomalous' phenomena such as near-death experiences, psi phenomena (such as telepathy) and spiritual experiences. But from a 'panspiritist' point of view - which sees spirit or consciousness as a fundamental essence of reality - it is possible to make sense of all these things.</p> <p>Steve Taylor puts forward the evidence for a spiritual view of reality, drawing on the insights of philosophers, physicists, mystics, as well as spiritual traditions and indigenous cultures. He systematically shows how a 'panspiritist' view can explain many puzzling aspects of science and the world, including evolution and the origins of life, and a wide range of other phenomena such as quantum physics, the placebo effect, precognition and neuroplasticity. Spiritual Science offers a new vision of the world that is compatible with both modern science and ancient spiritual teachings. It provides a more accurate and holistic account of reality than conventional science or religion, integrating a wide range of phenomena that are excluded from both. After showing how the materialist worldview demeans the world and human life, Spiritual Science offers, a vision of the world as sacred and interconnected and of human life as meaningful and purposeful. Spiritual Science explains how the standard materialist model of reality developed, and turned into a belief system. This belief system can only function by denying (or explaining away) a whole range of phenomena that are part of human experience</p> <h2 id=81-the-science-of-fate>81.

Yet, according to Tibet’s dream yoga tradition, ordinary waking life is no more real than the illusions of our nightly dreams. In his previous book Dream Yoga, Andrew Holecek guided us into Tibetan Buddhism’s nocturnal path of lucid dreaming and other dimensions of sleeping consciousness.</p> <p>Now, with Dreams of Light, he offers us an in-depth, step-by-step guide to its daytime practices. Known as the "illusory form" practices, these teachings include insights, meditations, and actions to help us realize the dreamlike nature of our lives. Through an immersive exploration of the tradition, beginners and seasoned practitioners alike will learn everything they need to deeply transform both their sleeping and waking hours."If you’ve struggled to awaken in your dreams," teaches Holecek, "these techniques will often spark spontaneous lucidity during sleep. And if you’re already a successful lucid dreamer, they will open you to new depths of experience throughout your day."

After working with medium Jennifer Shaffer talking to people directly, author began to focus his research on people who were NOT under hypnosis, but who could recall a vivid event; a dream, a near death experience or something that was consciousness altered.</p> <p>By asking simple questions to them about their experience, I found that I could "ask them" to invite "people on the flipside" into the conversation, including loved ones no longer on the planet, including guides, teachers and council members that are aware of all of their lifetimes, as well as have answers to key questions about the nature of reality, about consciousness about how things work. By asking nearly 50 people not under any form of hypnosis "the same questions" to these "people on the flipside" - I was startled to see that they said the same things about the journey that the people under hypnosis have said. Within these pages, people are going to read or here things that will upset their paradigm, that will challenge their belief system, that will force them to rethink (or at least consider rethinking) everything they've ever been told about the journey. As one science based author wrote to me in an email "Your experiments, which I have tried on my own and replicated, have "shaken me to my core." I am a filmmaker and author, I have been filming people talking about the afterlife for over a decade, and have reported extensively how I came to this line of questioning. These reports have been gathered over the past two years; some remain anonymous, some are not - either way, they're people fully conscious, eyes open, staring into the distance over my shoulder (or speaking live on the radio) accessing vistas and worlds I've heard about from other people. The reports are consistent and they are reproducible. We apparently choose our lifetimes, bring "about a third" of our conscious energy to any given performance, when the play is over, we "return home" to connect with our loved ones, teachers, and guides. These accounts point to another reality altogether - one that does not include fear, does not include attachment to worry, an understanding of why we each chose our lifetime and what we are here to learn. As Gary Schwartz PhD wrote in the Introduction to Flipside "As you read Richard’s journey of personal discovery in the context of these great questions, you will awaken to a vision of mind and the universe which is filled with opportunity and awe.</p> <h2 id=85-the-lab-points-on-the-practice-of-yoga-asanas>85.

The history of philosophy has been a predictably tragic or comical succession of palliatives for human disquiet. Thinkers from <strong>Spinoza</strong> to <strong>Berdyaev</strong> have pursued the perennial questions of how to be happy, how to be good, how to be loved, and how to live in a world of change and loss.</p> <p>But perhaps <strong>we can learn more from cats than from the great thinkers of the world.</strong> In Feline Philosophy, the philosopher <strong>John Gray</strong> discovers in cats a way of living that is unburdened by anxiety and self-consciousness, showing how they embody answers to the big questions of love and attachment, mortality, morality, and the Self. Montaigne's house cat, whose un-examined life may have been the one worth living; Meo, the Vietnam War survivor with an unshakable capacity for "fearless joy"; and Colette's Saha, the feline heroine of her subversive short story "The Cat", a parable about the pitfalls of human jealousy. Exploring the nature of cats, and what we can learn from it, Gray offers a profound, thought-provoking meditation on the follies of human exceptionalism and our fundamentally vulnerable and lonely condition. He charts a path toward a life without illusions and delusions, revealing how we can endure both crisis and transformation, and adapt to a changed scene, as cats have always done.</p> <h2 id=106-being-you-a-new-science-of-consciousness>106.

In physical reality, when we interact with an object and follow through with a perceived affordance, the resultant action tells us whether that affordance was real or false.

Huxley, William James, Lloyd Morgan, Rowland G. Hazard, 2021 </p> <p>Is Brain a Computer? Since René Descartes and his Cartesian philosophy, human brain has been depicted as a machine which has sensory inputs, and actions as output. This understanding gained a lot of interest especially in the 20<sup>th</sup> century with the development of computers and logical circuitry. Today, all our sciences (cognitive sciences, psychology, neuroscience, and so on) use brain-computer analogy in order to understand the workings of the brain and the essence of human mind. However, there is one big problem. We know that machines only perform what they are programmed to perform, and they obey the will of their designers.</p> <p>Then, how can we have conscious machines or automata which go beyond the limits of its programme and originate genuine behavior? In this book, you will discover some of the most-educated answers given to this and similar questions by the founding fathers of psychology and philosophy of mind. The articles are carefully selected among hundreds of similar writings on the subject in order to ease the reader's way into the subject. No background in pscyhology, phsyiology or philosophy is required. <strong>The book consists of 4 articles by</strong>: Thomas Henry Huxley (the great British biologist), William James (aka the founder of Pragmatism), Lloyd Morgan (aka the founding father of Academic Psychology), Rowland Hazard (the great American social reformer). In the book, you will find the answers to the following questions: What is an automaton? Is human body a machine/automaton? Does human brain work mechanically? Are animals automata? Are humans automata? Can machines think? Can machines gain consciousness? What are the physiological and biological basis of thoughts and ideas? Is mind a mechanism? Can a machine solve problems as well as humans do? You will also find many intriguing experiments on human and animal minds.</p> <p>Some excerpts from the book: "A French soldier, a sergeant, was wounded at the battle of Bareilles. The man was shot in what we call the left parietal bone. The bullet, I presume, glanced off, but it fractured the bone. ... At present this man lives two lives, a normal life and an abnormal life. In his normal life he is perfectly well, cheerful, and a capital hospital attendant, does all his work well, and is a respectable, well-conducted man. That normal life lasts for about seven-and-twenty days, or thereabouts, out of every month; but for a day or two in each month—generally at intervals of about that time—he passes into another life, suddenly, and without warning or intimation. In this life he is still active, goes about just as usual, ... nut in this condition he neither sees, nor hears, nor tastes, nor smells, nor is he conscious of any thing whatever, and has only one sense-organ in a state of activity—viz., that of touch, which is exceedingly delicate." Our problem consequently is: Of what use to a nervous system is a super added consciousness? Can a brain which has it function better than a brain without it? And to answer this question, we must know, first, the natural defects of the brain, and secondly, the peculiar powers of its mental correlate.</p> <h2 id=112-the-physics-of-consciousness>112.

In physical reality, when we interact with an object and follow through with a perceived affordance, the resultant action tells us whether that affordance was real or false.This book presents current knowledge of physics and highlights significant Indian contributions to the subject. The contents are as much about what is known as about what remains to be known and it speaks of a variety of paradoxes of mathematics and physics. They argue that there is a hidden order in physical reality that transcends the capacity of rational models help to illuminate the secrets of consciousness.</p> <h2 id=114-what-is-our-place-in-the-universe>114.

If yes, keep reading because this book will open a different view of the world for you. This provocative book proposes that the fourth dimension of existence can provide the perspective and comprehension necessary to arrive at logical answers to the unanswered questions of our existence. The Fourth Dimension of Existence draws on the author’s unique education. The author feels that a thorough fusion of the methodologies of science, philosophy, and religion could yield logical answers to the questions humans have been asking themselves since the dawn of human consciousness.</p> <h2 id=115-humanism-its-science-philosophy-an-introduction>115.

Jayarajan, 2021</p> <p>Humanism is an investigative journey through the mind of man within the reality of universal harmony of finite and infinite. Here the intellect is the infinite factor of consciousness, and the self is the finite factor consisting of biological, physical and mental regions. This book envisages the idea that a healthy mind is also a fully conscious mind where the finite self and infinite consciousness are harmonising with feminine-masculine principles to create and recreate the world with humanism.</p> <h2 id=116-the-rediscovery-of-hope-and-purpose>116. The Rediscovery of Hope and Purpose<a class=headerlink href=#116-the-rediscovery-of-hope-and-purpose title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><strong>Awakening the Human Spirit</strong> <br> Christopher W. Albrecht, 2021</p> <p>The world is hungry to have an awakening. Hope and purpose are just waiting to be discovered. This is my guidebook. In 1938, a three-year-old Bavarian boy's father was called to war. His destination was the Russian front. The boy vividly remembered the family's outhouse. Toilet paper hung from a wire, but when the Great War came, the toilet paper was replaced with newspaper. Then there came a day that the newspaper, too, would be gone. All that was left were the religious texts of the boy's father, a Lutheran minister.</p> <p>A decision by the boy's mother had to be made, and the fallout later would have a postwar German family trying to put the pieces of their lives back together. Their quest: to rediscover their hope and purpose when everything had been stripped away from their lives. The description came to me from my father in a handwritten letter in March of 2020 as the global pandemic was bringing back long buried thoughts about the war.The Rediscovery of Hope and Purpose projects light on a course of action for civic and personal development. This book is unique in that it does not advocate for change. A moral compass of hope and purpose is alive within each person, but over time many people lose the ability to recognize this. This book helps you, the reader, rediscover the comfort and joy that come from living a life of hope and purpose through a call to rediscovery, not change. Written from the vantage point of a seasoned educator who is a former New York State Teacher of the Year and National Teachers Hall of Famer, this book contains explicit examples to guide readers by focusing on factors that can improve individuals and communities. The Rediscovery of Hope and Purpose challenges hopelessness by providing an uplifting experience. The book is designed to drive home a compelling message that hope and purpose are eternal fires ready to be rediscovered. It unlocks the shackles so many have clamped on hope allowing for a reawakening. Ten highly encaptivating interviews with inspiring people from all walks of life, intertwined with narratives, and history provide an investigation into social philosophy that promise the reader to think deeper and reflect stronger on the future. This book is based in a brand-new genre coined <strong>Investigative Social Philosophy</strong>.</p> <h2 id=117-universal-human-creating-authentic-power-and-the-new-consciousness>117. Universal Human : Creating Authentic Power and the New Consciousness<a class=headerlink href=#117-universal-human-creating-authentic-power-and-the-new-consciousness title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Gary Zukav, 2021</p> <p>The Seat of the Soul shows us step-by-fascinating-step how to create a life of love and where that now leads. Universal Human gives us new tools to grow spiritually and shows us how to transform everyday experiences of hopelessness, emptiness, and pain into fulfillment, meaning, and joy.</p> <p>It points us toward a startling new destination (a species that is beyond culture, religion, nation, ethnic group, and gender a species whose allegiance is to Life first and all else second) and shows us how to get there. Universal Human examines our disintegrating social structures and the new social structures that are replacing them. It shows us a new creation story (our new creation story—as we create it with our choices, our deeds, and our words. A new human consciousness is replacing the old human consciousness. Authentic power—the alignment of the personality with soul) is replacing external power, the ability to manipulate and control. Author explains that the potential of a new era of humanity based on love instead of fear is upon us, but only we can bring it into being. Universal Human shows us how.</p> <p><strong>Author</strong> <br> Dr Hari Thapliyaal <br> dasarpai.com <br> linkedin.com/in/harithapliyal </p> </article> </div> <script>var target=document.getElementById(location.hash.slice(1));target&&target.name&&(target.checked=target.name.startsWith("__tabbed_"))</script> </div> <button type=button class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8z"/></svg> Back to top </button> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright &copy;
