src=../assets/images/dspost/dsp6051-Cognitive-Biases.jpg> </p> <h1 id=cognitive-biases>Cognitive Biases<a class=headerlink href=#cognitive-biases title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1> <h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a class=headerlink href=#introduction title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Cognitive biases are the systematic errors that occur when individuals deviate from rational decision-making. These biases are a result of our brain's ability to process information, which can sometimes lead to irrational thinking and decision-making. As data science continues to advance, it is critical to understand how cognitive biases can impact AI, ML, NLP, deep learning, and robotics. Cognitive biases can lead to biased data collection, modeling, and decision-making processes, which can ultimately impact the accuracy and effectiveness of these technologies.</p> <p>One of the most significant challenges in data science is developing models that can accurately represent and predict complex human behaviors. However, cognitive biases can significantly impact the data used to train these models. For example, <strong>confirmation bias</strong> can lead to the selection of only certain data that confirms preconceived notions, while <strong>availability bias</strong> can lead to over-reliance on easily available data. As such, it is essential for data scientists to be aware of cognitive biases and take steps to mitigate their impact on the accuracy of their models.</p> <p>There are many books, blogs articles, youTube discussion and talk around on this topic. Recenlty I found some wikipages which disucsses this in a great length. I am taking liberty for educating my audience to extract the text and summarise here.</p> <h2 id=belief-decision-making-and-behavioral>Belief, decision-making and behavioral<a class=headerlink href=#belief-decision-making-and-behavioral title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>These biases affect belief formation, reasoning processes, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general. </p> <h3 id=anchoring-bias>Anchoring bias<a class=headerlink href=#anchoring-bias title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p><strong>Common source bias</strong> , the tendency to combine or compare research studies from the same source, or from sources that use the same methodologies or data. <br> <strong>Conservatism bias</strong> , the tendency to insufficiently revise one's belief when presented with new evidence. <br> <strong>Functional fixedness</strong> , a tendency limiting a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. <br> <strong>Law of the instrument</strong> , an over-reliance on a familiar tool or methods, ignoring or under-valuing alternative approaches. "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." </p> <h3 id=apophenia>Apophenia<a class=headerlink href=#apophenia title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p><strong>Clustering illusion</strong> , the tendency to overestimate the importance of small runs, streaks, or clusters in large samples of random data (that is, seeing phantom patterns). <br> <strong>Illusory correlation</strong> , a tendency to inaccurately perceive a relationship between two unrelated events. <br> <strong>Pareidolia</strong> , a tendency to perceive a vague and random stimulus (often an image or sound) as significant, e.g., seeing images of animals or faces in clouds, the man in the Moon, and hearing non-existent hidden messages on records played in reverse. </p> <h3 id=availability-heuristic>Availability heuristic<a class=headerlink href=#availability-heuristic title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p><strong>Anthropocentric thinking</strong> , the tendency to use human analogies as a basis for reasoning about other, less familiar, biological phenomena. <br> <strong>Anthropomorphism or personification</strong> , the tendency to characterize animals, objects, and abstract concepts as possessing human-like traits, emotions, and intentions. The opposite bias, of not attributing feelings or thoughts to another person, is dehumanised perception, a type of objectification. <br> <strong>Attentional bias</strong> , the tendency of perception to be affected by recurring thoughts. <br> <strong>Frequency illusion or Baader–Meinhof phenomenon.</strong> The frequency illusion is that once something has been noticed then every instance of that thing is noticed, leading to the belief it has a high frequency of occurrence (a form of selection bias). The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon is the illusion where something that has recently come to one's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards. It was named after an incidence of frequency illusion in which the Baader–Meinhof Group was mentioned. <br> <strong>Implicit association</strong> , where the speed with which people can match words depends on how closely they are associated. <br> <strong>Salience bias</strong> , the tendency to focus on items that are more prominent or emotionally striking and ignore those that are unremarkable, even though this difference is often irrelevant by objective standards. See also von Restorff effect. <br> <strong>Selection bias</strong> , which happens when the members of a statistical sample are not chosen completely at random, which leads to the sample not being representative of the population. <br> <strong>Survivorship bias</strong> , which is concentrating on the people or things that "survived" some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility. <br> <strong>Well travelled road effect</strong> , the tendency to underestimate the duration taken to traverse oft-travelled routes and overestimate the duration taken to traverse less familiar routes. </p> <h3 id=cognitive-dissonance>Cognitive dissonance<a class=headerlink href=#cognitive-dissonance title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p><strong>The Normalcy bias</strong> , a form of cognitive dissonance, is the refusal to plan for, or react to, a disaster which has never happened before. <br> <strong>Effort justification</strong> is a person's tendency to attribute greater value to an outcome if they had to put effort into achieving it. This can result in more value being applied to an outcome than it actually has. An example of this is the IKEA effect, the tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end product. <br> <strong>Ben Franklin effect</strong> , where a person who has performed a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for that person than they would be if they had received a favor from that person. </p> <p>### Confirmation bias <br> <strong>Backfire effect</strong> , a tendency to react to disconfirming evidence by strengthening one's previous beliefs. The existence of this bias as a widespread phenomenon has been disputed in empirical studies. <br> <strong>Congruence bias</strong> , the tendency to test hypotheses exclusively through direct testing, instead of testing possible alternative hypotheses. <br> <strong>Experimenter's or expectation bias</strong> , the tendency for experimenters to believe, certify, and publish data that agree with their expectations for the outcome of an experiment, and to disbelieve, discard, or downgrade the corresponding weightings for data that appear to conflict with those expectations. <br> <strong>Observer-expectancy effect</strong> , when a researcher expects a given result and therefore unconsciously manipulates an experiment or misinterprets data in order to find it (see also subject-expectancy effect). <br> <strong>Selective perception</strong> , the tendency for expectations to affect perception.<br> <strong>Semmelweis reflex</strong> , the tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts a paradigm. </p> <h3 id=egocentric-bias>Egocentric bias<a class=headerlink href=#egocentric-bias title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p><strong>Bias blind spot</strong> , the tendency to see oneself as less biased than other people, or to be able to identify more cognitive biases in others than in oneself. <br> <strong>False consensus effect</strong> , the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them. <br> <strong>False uniqueness bias</strong> , the tendency of people to see their projects and themselves as more singular than they actually are. <br> <strong>Forer effect or Barnum effect</strong> , the tendency for individuals to give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, graphology, and some types of personality tests. <br> <strong>Illusion of asymmetric insight</strong> , where people perceive their knowledge of their peers to surpass their peers' knowledge of them. <br> <strong>Illusion of control</strong> , the tendency to overestimate one's degree of influence over other external events. <br> <strong>Illusion of transparency</strong> , the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others, and to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states. <br> <strong>Illusion of validity</strong> , the tendency to overestimate the accuracy of one's judgments, especially when available information is consistent or inter-correlated. <br> <strong>Illusory superiority</strong> , the tendency to overestimate one's desirable qualities, and underestimate undesirable qualities, relative to other people. (Also known as "Lake Wobegon effect", "better-than-average effect", or "superiority bias".) <br> <strong>Naïve cynicism</strong> , expecting more egocentric bias in others than in oneself. <br> <strong>Naïve realism</strong> , the belief that we see reality as it really is—objectively and without bias; that the facts are plain for all to see; that rational people will agree with us; and that those who do not are either uninformed, lazy, irrational, or biased. <br> <strong>Overconfidence effect</strong> , a tendency to have excessive confidence in one's own answers to questions.

A form of serial position effect. Cf. recency effect and primacy effect. <br> <strong>Subadditivity effect</strong> : The tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components. <br> <strong>Tachypsychia</strong> : When time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts. <br> <strong>Telescoping effect</strong> : The tendency to displace recent events backwards in time and remote events forward in time, so that recent events appear more remote, and remote events, more recent. <br> <strong>Testing effect</strong> : The fact that one more easily recall information one has read by rewriting it instead of rereading it. Frequent testing of material that has been committed to memory improves memory recall. <br> <strong>Tip of the tongue phenomenon</strong> : When a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought to be an instance of "blocking" where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other. <br> <strong>Travis syndrome</strong> : Overestimating the significance of the present. It is related to chronological snobbery with possibly an appeal to novelty logical fallacy being part of the bias. <br> <strong>Verbatim effect</strong> : That the "gist" of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording. This is because memories are representations, not exact copies. <br> <strong>von Restorff effect</strong> : That an item that sticks out is more likely to be remembered than other items. <br> <strong>Zeigarnik effect</strong> : That uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones. </p> <h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion:<a class=headerlink href=#conclusion title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>In conclusion, cognitive biases can have a profound impact on the accuracy and effectiveness of AI, ML, NLP, deep learning, and robotics. To mitigate these biases, data scientists should be aware of their existence and actively work to counteract them. By identifying potential sources of bias and taking steps to prevent them, data scientists can ensure that their models accurately represent complex human behaviors and decision-making processes. This, in turn, will lead to more effective and accurate technologies that have the potential to revolutionize many areas of our lives.</p> <h2 id=sources>Sources:<a class=headerlink href=#sources title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <ul> <li>Various internet pages and wikipedia pages</li> </ul> <p><strong>Recompiled by</strong> <br> Dr Hari Thapliyaal <br> dasarpai.com <br> linkedin.com/in/harithapliyal </p> <div class=author-bio style="margin-top: 2rem; display: flex; gap: 1rem;"> <img src=../assets/images/myphotos/Profilephoto1.jpg alt="Hari Thapliyaal" style="border-radius: 50%; width: 80px; height: 80px;"> <div> <strong>Dr. Hari Thapliyaal</strong><br> <small>Dr. Hari Thapliyal is a prolific blogger and seasoned professional with an extensive background in Data Science, Project Management, and Advait-Vedanta Philosophy.
