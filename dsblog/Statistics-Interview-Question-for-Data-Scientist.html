link">&para;</a></h1> <blockquote> <p>In this question-answer blog, I will try to answer that every question starts with an example rather than a theory or definition (some unavoidable variation may be possible). I firmly believe if examples are clear, then a human mind is smart enough in generalizing, creating theories and definitions.</p> <p>The purpose of this blog is not to give you clear-cut definitions of important concepts of statistics but help you in visualizing the ideas in your mind. So that even without the definitions you understand what a particular idea means.</p> <p>This blog is written keeping learners from software engineering background in mind. They have a lot of confusion around the naming convention used in statistics like event, experiments, variable, test, sample, significance, confidence level, theoretical probability, statistical measure and their calculation, etc.</p> <p>To give an example, in most of the places, I will use the “job_applicant” dataset. This dataset has data about the people who applied for a job in the company and applicants were either selected or rejected by the company. So the information in this dataset is the applicant's name, date of birth, date of application, job applied, last salary, education, living_city, selected, etc.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id=about-statistics>About Statistics<a class=headerlink href=#about-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1> <h2 id=can-you-tell-me-about-population-space-or-sample-space>Can you tell me about population space or sample space?<a class=headerlink href=#can-you-tell-me-about-population-space-or-sample-space title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Population space where all the observation are stored. Sample space is where some of the observation are stored. If your organization has 300K employees then the population space of all the employees of your organization is 300K. If you create a sample of 100 employees from this sample space then 100 employee are forming a sample space. Sample space is creating in sampling process. Every sampling has some purpose, therefore it must ensure that sample represents the population. There are many techniques to ensure this.</p> <p>If there are 5 variables like Name, Age, Gender, Title, Salary then no two observations in the population or sample dataset can have the same information. Possible outcome of 2 observations in sample or population space can be "John Smith", who is 35 years old, male, has a job title of "Manager", and earns a salary of $ 70,000. Another possible outcome could be the employee named "Jane Doe", who is 42 years old, female, has a job title of "Engineer", and earns a salary of $80,000.</p> <p>A sample space, often denoted by the symbol S, is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. The population space, often denoted by the symbol Ω, is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process. The population space is typically not known and it is the sample space that we use to make inferences about the population.</p> <h2 id=what-is-random-process-random-experiment-random-event-all-are-the-same-thing-or-different>What is Random Process, Random Experiment, Random Event, all are the same thing or different?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-random-process-random-experiment-random-event-all-are-the-same-thing-or-different title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>A random process is a sequence of events that cannot be predicted exactly. For example, tomorrow's stock price of X stock. It depends on many dozens of variables.</p> <p>A random experiment is an experiment in which the outcome is uncertain and can take on different values based on chance or probability. Traffic movement, dice throw, selecting employee, coin throw.</p> <p>A random event is a specific outcome of a random process. Coming head in tossing random process, coming 4 in dice throw random process, selecting Ph.D holder from employee dataset, a vehicle can turn right on a traffic light.</p> <h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-variable-and-random-variable>What is the difference between variable and random variable?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-difference-between-variable-and-random-variable title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>An observation has attribute, for example an employee # 108 is one observation from our sample of population dataset. It has many attributes like name, age, gender, salary, position etc. These are variables. Any employee can have any value corresponding to these variables. </p> <p>Random variable is a variable whose values are determined by a random process. For example if there can be only one job_position out of 4 job_position, then job_position variable is random variable. Output of random variables follows some distribution like normal distribution.</p> <p>Every random variable is a variable but every variable is not a random variable.</p> <h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-measure-tool-technique-method-and-process>What is the difference between Measure, Tool, Technique, Method, and Process?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-difference-between-measure-tool-technique-method-and-process title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <ul> <li>A measure is a <strong>way to calculate</strong>. It is a metric. For example mean, median, and mode are measures to know the central tendency of data. In our example dataset we can summarize the age column, as "mean age"=35 years, or median age is 38 years.</li> <li>A tool is a physical object or software or app used <strong>to accomplish a task</strong>. For example, Microsoft Project for creating a project schedule and identifying a critical path.</li> <li>A technique is a <strong>method or procedure used to accomplish a task</strong>. It is related to a simple problem. For example, a technique used to open the lid of an air-tight box or visualize 4 dimensional data on a 2D plane.</li> <li>A method is a <strong>systematic approach</strong> to solve a problem. It is more related to creativity and refers to a larger problem. For example, a method of cracking an IAS exam.</li> <li>A process is a <strong>series of steps or actions</strong> taken to achieve a desired result. For example the process of hiring.</li> </ul> <h2 id=what-is-the-meaning-of-sample-in-statistics-and-how-is-it-different-from-observation>What is the meaning of "sample" in statistics and how is it different from "observation"?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-meaning-of-sample-in-statistics-and-how-is-it-different-from-observation title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>In statistics, <strong>a sample is a subset of a population</strong> that is chosen for the purpose of the study. A sample is a representation of the population. The goal of sampling is to select a group of individuals from a population that will be representative of the population as a whole. A sample is used to make inferences about the population from which it was drawn. A sample is used for estimating population parameters, such as the mean or standard deviation, and to test hypotheses about the population.</p> <p>An observation, on the other hand, <strong>refers to a single measurement or data point</strong>. Observations are the individual pieces of data collected in a study. A sample can contain multiple observations, for example, a sample of 100 people means 100 different observations of different individuals, each observation can have multiple data points such as age, gender, income, etc.</p> <p>In summary, a sample is a subset of a population, which is chosen to represent the population, while an observation is a single data point or measurement collected from an individual within the sample. A sample is used to make inferences about the population, whereas observations are used to make inferences about the sample.</p> <p><img alt="observation sample population" src=../assets/images/dspost/statistics/observation-sample-population.png></p> <h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-census>What is the difference between statistics and census?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-census title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data. It is about <strong>sample</strong> data (a portion of the entire population). </p> <p><strong>Census</strong> is the process of collecting and counting data about a <strong>population</strong>. For example, to study the economic well-being of tribal people, if you can collect some sample data then it is part of statistics. But if you collect data on the entire tribal population then it is a census.</p> <h2 id=what-are-observational-data-and-experimental-data-in-statistics>What are observational data, and experimental data in Statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-are-observational-data-and-experimental-data-in-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Observational Data: If you want to know whether there is any relationship between <strong>overtime working</strong> and <strong>number of defects produced</strong> then you collect the data and check the relationship. This collected data is observational data. Before collecting the data, we don't have any intention of experimenting. We just want to know. To establish the relationship just observation of existing data is enough.</p> <p>Experimental Data: If you <strong>change the number of working hours</strong> then what is the impact of this on <strong>number of defects produced</strong>? This way, you experiment with different working hours, sometimes you increase the hours, and at other times you decrease the hours. This collected data is experimental data. Before collecting the data I have an intention to experiment. In one experiment, we increased the number of working hours and then noted the number of defects. In another experiment, we decreased the number of working hours and then noted the number of defects. To establish this relationship you need to experiment multiple times.</p> <h2 id=are-statistical-measures-and-statistical-methods-the-same>Are statistical measures and statistical methods the same?<a class=headerlink href=#are-statistical-measures-and-statistical-methods-the-same title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>No, Statistical measures are the <strong>numerical values</strong> used to describe data, like mean, median, and standard deviation. While statistical methods are the <strong>techniques</strong> used to analyze data like regression, and statistical tests.</p> <h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-statistics>What are the different types of statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-are-the-different-types-of-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The different types of statistics are - Descriptive statistics - Inferential statistics - Predictive analytics.</p> <h2 id=what-is-descriptive-statistics>What is Descriptive statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-descriptive-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Descriptive statistics is the process of summarizing and organizing data in order to describe the characteristics of a <strong>population or sample</strong>. It includes measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and covariance. Each measure has a different formula to calculate. Apart from that, the same measure can be calculated differently for different data distributions.</p> <h2 id=what-is-inferential-statistics>What is Inferential statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-inferential-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Inferential Statistics is a form of statistical analysis used to make inferences or draw conclusions from a given dataset. Generally, this involves <strong>testing assumptions and hypotheses about the data</strong>, such as if there is a relationship between two variables, or what the effect of one variable has on another. Inferential Statistics can help researchers to better understand the population they are studying.</p> <h2 id=what-is-predictive-statistics>What is predictive statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-predictive-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Predictive Statistics is a branch of statistics used to make predictions about future events or outcomes. This is done by analyzing data sets and using mathematical models to uncover patterns and correlations that can be used to forecast potential results and trends. Predictive Statistics can be used in many different areas such as marketing, business forecasting, machine learning, and health care. Machine learning models are built for predictive statistics.</p> <h2 id=what-are-statistical-measures-of-descriptive-statistics>What are statistical measures of Descriptive Statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-are-statistical-measures-of-descriptive-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Descriptive statistics measures include mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and covariance. In statistics, we can study, and analyze these measures for sample data or for population data. In fact, when it is not possible to do a census then we use these measures of sample data and predict/extrapolate/postulate about the population measure. For example, if you want to know the average life expectancy of Indian women then you collect sample data and using that you can postulate about the average age of the entire indian women population. There is a process for doing this. In this process, there can be errors and there are processes of handling/factoring that error component.</p> <h2 id=what-are-statistical-measures-in-inferential-statistics>What are statistical measures in Inferential Statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-are-statistical-measures-in-inferential-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Inferential statistics measures include z-score, t-test, chi-square test, correlation coefficient, confidence interval, and p-value.</p> <h2 id=what-are-statistical-measures-in-predictive-statistics>What are statistical measures in Predictive Statistics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-are-statistical-measures-in-predictive-statistics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>To measure the performance of statistical models we have several measures.

It is used to make predictions and analyze data. The data generated by the model and real-world data will have some differences and this is called an error in the model. For example, based on certain parameters like carpet_area, number_of_bedroom, etc. a model can predict house price should be 1.2 crores, but the actual price is 1 core. Thus, the model is predicting the price as 20 lakhs Rupees more. This is a model error. Keeping people's behavior, market opportunities, etc in mind we can never make a statistical model with zero error. But if I could guess the distribution of input variables correctly then the output of our model will have fewer errors.</p> <h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-statistical-model-and-mathematical-model>What is the difference between Statistical Model and Mathematical Model?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-difference-between-statistical-model-and-mathematical-model title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Mathematical models are deterministic, the input is clearly known, the outcome is fixed.

For the same carpet area the price is different. It is not only because of other parameters but because of market opportunities. Thus input and output of the model will be probabilistic.

It is commonly used in the analysis of repeated measures data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>It's important to choose the appropriate correlation coefficient based on the nature of the data and the type of relationship you are interested in.</p> <h2 id=what-is-autocorrelation>What is AutoCorrelation?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-autocorrelation title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Let’s say we have share price data of a company. These observations are monthly. We want to know if there is any pattern in this monthly data? For that purpose we try the relationship between the stock price. But this time the original stock price is associated with “after month share price”. This shifting is called one month lagging, it means 1949-01 data is compared with 1949-02 data, and so on. Similarly you can shift data 2 time periods or 3 time periods. When you check the relationship between original share price and 1 lagged shared price or 2 lagged shared price or 3 lagged share price it gives you a correlation coefficient. This process is called AutoCorrelation. Whatever number of month’s shifts shows higher correlation, that number of months is interesting for us. </p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Mean=&gt;</th> <th>127</th> <th></th> <th>128</th> <th>127</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Passengers (y)</td> <td><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(y_{t-1}\)</span>\)</span></td> <td><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(y_{t-2}\)</span>\)</span></td> <td><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(y_{t-3}\)</span>\)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-01</td> <td>112</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-02</td> <td>118</td> <td>112</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-03</td> <td>132</td> <td>118</td> <td>112</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-04</td> <td>129</td> <td>132</td> <td>118</td> <td>112</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-05</td> <td>121</td> <td>129</td> <td>132</td> <td>118</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-06</td> <td>135</td> <td>121</td> <td>129</td> <td>132</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-07</td> <td>148</td> <td>135</td> <td>121</td> <td>129</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-08</td> <td>148</td> <td>148</td> <td>135</td> <td>121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-09</td> <td>136</td> <td>148</td> <td>148</td> <td>135</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-10</td> <td>119</td> <td>136</td> <td>148</td> <td>148</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-11</td> <td>104</td> <td>119</td> <td>136</td> <td>148</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949-12</td> <td>118</td> <td>104</td> <td>119</td> <td>136</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1950-01</td> <td>115</td> <td>118</td> <td>104</td> <td>119</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1950-02</td> <td>126</td> <td>115</td> <td>118</td> <td>104</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id=what-is-the-autocorrelation-formula>What is the AutoCorrelation formula?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-autocorrelation-formula title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The AutoCorrelation formula is the same as the Correlation formula.

Let's say our salary column minimum value 20,000, maximum value 150,000 and mean value 50,000. If this column is normally distributed then 50% of the people will have a salary &lt;=50,000 and 50% of the people will have a salary &gt;50,000. When you convert this column into z-scale you need to calculate the z-score of every value. In that situation the z-value of the mean will become 0, and less than mean values will become negative z-values and more than mean values will become positive z-values. After this scaling you can say 99% of the data is within -3 to +3 Z scale. You can pick-up any other column, like age, which is a completely different scale compared to salary. When you convert that into z-scale then 99% of the age will be within -3 to +3 z scale. For calculating z score we can use the formula <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\)</span>\)</span>. This is called standard scaling of salary column values.</p> <p>Thus a z-score is a description of how far a sample or point of data is away from its mean. Z score value can be negative or positive. Larger the absolute z score value of any point, far away that is from the mean. For example, if we want to calculate the z-score of a salary 30,000 then the Z score of 30,000 = (30,000 - 50,000) /10,000 = -2. It means a 30,000 salary is 2 distance away from the mean, but left side.</p> <p>If we want to convert a salary of 70,000 into sigma value we get z score = (70,000-50,000)/10,000 = 2. It means a 70,000 salary is also 2 distance away from the mean but right side.</p> <p>During a statistical test we need to make sure that z score of any given value should not fall in the critical range, otherwise the null hypothesis will be rejected. We will discuss this in detail at another place.</p> <p><strong>Because of its utility and applications, In statistics and process control perhaps Sigma or SD or Standard Deviation is the most popular measure.</strong></p> <p><strong>Sigma of Statistics, Sigma of process control and Z score are confusing and sometimes used interchangeably.</strong></p> <h2 id=what-is-the-sigma-value-in-statistics-normal-distribution>What is the Sigma value in Statistics (Normal Distribution)?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-sigma-value-in-statistics-normal-distribution title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>It helps us in understanding the distribution of sample data.

It is a measure of the variability of the sample mean. It is used to estimate the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.</p> <p>To understand this concept, let's consider an example. Imagine you are studying the heights of adult males in a certain population. The population mean height is 170 cm and the population standard deviation is 10 cm. If you take a sample of 5 adult males, you would calculate the sample mean height. Each time you take a different sample of 5 adult males, you would get a different sample mean height.</p> <p>Now, imagine taking many samples of 5 adult males, each time calculating the "sample mean height". The distribution of the "sample mean heights" is known as the "sampling distribution of the mean". The SD of this "sampling distribution of the mean" is called the "standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean" or the "standard error of the sample mean".</p> <p>In other words, the "standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean" is a measure of the variability of the sample mean. It tells us how much the sample mean is likely to deviate from the population mean, given a certain sample size. The smaller the "standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean", the more precise the sample mean is as an estimate of the population mean. This means, as the sample size increases, the "standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean" decreases, the sample mean becomes a more accurate estimate of the population mean.</p> <div class=arithmatex>\[SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]</div> <p>SE is the Standard Error, <br> s is the standard deviation of the sample<br> n is the sample size</p> <p>In our dataset if the salary column has mean_slary=50,000 then we know some observations will have less than 50K and others will have more than 50K.

In other words, there is a clear direction to the relationship, but <strong>the relationship may not necessarily be linear</strong>.</p> <p>For example, consider the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. As temperature increases, ice cream sales are likely to increase as well. This is a positive monotonic relationship, because one variable (temperature) increases consistently as the other variable (ice cream sales) increases. On the other hand, if temperature were to decrease as ice cream sales increased, the relationship would be <strong>negative monotonic</strong>.</p> <p>Monotonic relationships can be measured using <strong>nonparametric statistical techniques</strong>, such as the <strong>Spearman rank correlation coefficient</strong> or the <strong>Kendall rank correlation coefficient</strong>. These techniques are based on the ranks of the values rather than the raw data, and they are less sensitive to deviations from a linear relationship than parametric techniques such as the Pearson correlation coefficient.</p> <h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-nonparametric-measure-vs-parametric-measure>What is the difference between nonparametric measure vs parametric measure?<a class=headerlink href=#what-is-the-difference-between-nonparametric-measure-vs-parametric-measure title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Parametric measures are statistical techniques that make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. These assumptions are usually about the shape of the distribution and the presence of certain statistical properties, such as a normal distribution or constant variance. Let's say our dataset has earthquake information, size of earthquakes, and number of casualties. If we plot the distribution of earthquake size you will not have normal distribution, it will have exponential distribution. But if we were having an employee dataset and age is mentioned there then you can assume that age will have normal distribution. Because of assumption you can use a parametric test with a small dataset to conclude about the larger sample. Parametric tests like t-test can infer with sample size&lt;30, on the other hand parametric tests like z-test can infer about population with sample size around 30.</p> <p>Nonparametric measures, on the other hand, <strong>do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.</strong> They are more flexible and can be <strong>used with a wider range of data types</strong>, but they may be <strong>less powerful</strong> than parametric measures because they make fewer assumptions about the data.</p> <p>One of the main differences between parametric and nonparametric measures is the way they handle <strong>missing data</strong>. Parametric measures typically require complete datasets, while nonparametric measures are more robust to missing data. </p> <p>It's important to choose the appropriate statistical technique based on the nature of the data and the research question you are trying to answer. In general, parametric measures are more powerful when the assumptions they make about the data are met, but nonparametric measures may be more appropriate when these assumptions are not met.</p> <h2 id=when-is-median-better-than-mean-measure>When is Median better than Mean measure?<a class=headerlink href=#when-is-median-better-than-mean-measure title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>If you have 2 people in your dataset whose salary is 4 cr and 5 cr, then the mean will shift to the right side.

In the case of exponential distribution central tendencies will not be arithmetic mean but geometric mean. - Mean, Median, Mode, Range, SD, Kurtosis, Coefficient of Variation, SD, Skewness - <strong>Each measure has different formula for calculation</strong></p> <h2 id=some-additional-notes-for-data-scientists>Some Additional Notes for Data Scientists.<a class=headerlink href=#some-additional-notes-for-data-scientists title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>A data scientist is dealing with different streams of subjects like statistics, database, software engineering, geometry, vector and metrics, and calculus at the same time. There are certain terms which are referred to differently by different subjects. To avoid the confusion I am putting them below.<br> - Variable of statistics = Column of database = Field of database = Basis vector of geometry. They all refer to the same thing. - Records of database = tuple of database = observation of statistics = vector of geometry. - Slope of Geometry = Gradient of calculus = Gradient in Deep Learning and Machine Learning. The value of slope or gradient can be between <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(-\infty \,\, to \,\,+\infty\)</span>\)</span></p> <h2 id=resources>Resources<a class=headerlink href=#resources title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>If any of the link breaks then you can search for these books at <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14wS6JWWDsZ2TEXCD9A7jgLVCEVEd1Mpb?usp=drive_link">location</a></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rwFT2l39UsuNs9kyyqoSLsxH-zMk5FBx/view?usp=sharing">Statistics_Cartoon_Guide-BOOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RhqHx_7suKuHamekBkEHvwn5OjUD4sds/view?usp=sharing">Probability and Statistics for Data Science-BOOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMa7FSwkY_AkI6UrtnhgPIWEjNs60kLY/view?usp=sharing">Comprehensive &amp; Practical Inferential Statistics Guide-GUIDE</a></li> <li><a href>Statistics and Machine Learning in Python-BOOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZUsZUPf5E8d7oc3WOFgLItWsyu12DBG/view?usp=sharing">Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists-BOOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/112akj_HiddwvTshbgzvQFN299bfugib0/view?usp=sharing">Probability &amp; Statistics with Applications to Computing-BOOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p6H6mvNBrfOoW9Dp2tX0l5I-667Zor3h/view?usp=sharing">Statistics Demystified-BOOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dX-BbLPjN-pKVOmidrkT_Imh9mmMzeX_/view?usp=share_link">HypothesisTesting-PPT</a></li> <li><a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/what-is-a-z-score-what-is-a-p-value.htm#:~:text=The%20critical%20z%2Dscore%20values,1.96%20and%20%2B1.96%20standard%20deviations.">What is a z-score?
