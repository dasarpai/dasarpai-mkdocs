However, Quantum Physics, despite all my reading and learning, remains a mystery to me. At this stage, who can teach me Quantum Physics effectively? Finding an able professor, aligning my availability with theirs, and hoping they’d be willing to teach me for free seems impossible. So, I turned to a Large Language Model (LLM) for help. I could have explored other LLMs like Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, and many more. I’m not saying the others are bad, nor am I claiming that ChatGPT is the best at providing plausible answers. Whether an answer is correct or plausible also depends on the learner’s ability.</p> <p>This extensive session with ChatGPT has been a great learning experience for me. It has taught me so much about Quantum Physics, while simultaneously revealing how powerless LLMs can be when we don’t ask the right questions. We might criticize these LLMs as mere "next-word predictors," but their power is undeniably immense. At the same time, I realize that without great teachers and researchers, we cannot advance science relying solely on LLMs. Yes, these models are more powerful than most humans in certain ways, but among humans, there are exceptional minds like Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Ramanujan, and Aryabhata. It’s true that not all humans match their caliber, but we must recognize that creating such intellects requires a supportive society, systems, culture, and upbringing—conditions that allow such extraordinary individuals to emerge and challenge these AI systems. This challenge isn’t about discarding AI but about improving it and using it for the betterment of humanity.</p> <h2 id=questions-i-asked>Questions I asked<a class=headerlink href=#questions-i-asked title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <ol> <li>How come a quantum bit be 0 and 1 at the same time?</li> <li>There is fault in "coin in air" analogy.</li> <li>What are the foundations of quantum physics?</li> <li>Why it is impossible to determine position and momentum at the same time?</li> <li>Why do we say electron has wave particle duality?</li> <li>What is the meaning that electron has wave nature?</li> <li>Can you help me understanding wavefunction?</li> <li>What path electron follow while traveling?</li> <li>What is the meaning of electron is spread out during journey?</li> <li>Does wavefunction keep changing during the travel?</li> <li>How can a free electron with a constant energy moving through space?</li> <li>How an electron can collide with atom?</li> <li>Why electrons are negatively charged?</li> <li>What is the smallest measurable charge?</li> <li>What is coulomb and how to measure that?</li> <li>There is a Gap in 1 Coulomb calculation value</li> <li>How do we count that the number of electron is 6.242×10 ^18</li> <li>How did we reach to this conclusion that 1ev or electron's charge is exactly this?</li> <li>How much is 1 coulomb charge?</li> <li>How to measure how many electron has moved?</li> <li>If I want to measure number of electron moved in 10 watt bulb in 1 hour then how to do that?</li> <li>How to measure 1 joule?</li> <li>There is confusion in 1 joule calculation.</li> <li>Conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics</li> <li>How come massless gives rise to mass?</li> <li>How can a photon achieve high energy?</li> <li>How photon can have momentum when mass is zero?</li> <li>What is the size of photon and electron that they collide and effect each other?</li> <li>We don't know the size of a light particle of 500 nm wavelength!</li> <li>When electron don't have definite size then how do we measure their mass?</li> <li>Particles in Classical vs Quantum Physics.</li> <li>What Does "Finding" an Electron Mean?</li> <li>Water wave - Electron wave analogy is not correct.</li> <li>The meaning of electron's wavefunction can exist in a superposition of states.</li> <li>I can find a particular electron anywhere in the universe!</li> <li>Can I go thousands of mile away and find that electron there?</li> <li>What are different possible location of an electron?</li> <li>A wavefunction is function of multiple functions, right?</li> <li>How to construct a wavefunction?</li> <li>Refine this wavefunction for 3D space.</li> <li>With a given wavefunction, can we location particle at time t?</li> <li>If I give you radius and wavefunction can you locate electron?</li> <li>It is crazy, I need some expert now!</li> </ol> <h2 id=how-come-a-quantum-bit-be-0-and-1-at-the-same-time>How come a quantum bit be 0 and 1 at the same time?<a class=headerlink href=#how-come-a-quantum-bit-be-0-and-1-at-the-same-time title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>When they say a quantum bit (qubit) can be "zero and one at the same time," they are referring to <strong>superposition</strong>, which allows a qubit to exist in a combination of both states until it is measured. This is a unique feature of quantum systems, making quantum computing different from classical computing.</p> <p><strong>Classical vs. Quantum Bits</strong> - <strong>Classical bits</strong> (the ones in traditional computing) can be in one of two states at any time: either 0 or 1. - <strong>Quantum bits (qubits)</strong>, on the other hand, can exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of both 0 and 1 states simultaneously, meaning that a qubit can be in a state that is a combination of both 0 and 1.</p> <p><strong>What is Superposition?</strong> - In classical computing, you would have a bit that is either in state 0 or state 1. But in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a <strong>quantum state</strong> that can be a <strong>linear combination</strong> (or superposition) of both states.</p> <p>For example, a qubit might be in a state that is 50% 0 and 50% 1, or any other combination. Mathematically, this is represented as: $$<span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(\text{qubit state} = \alpha \|0\rangle + \beta \|1\rangle\)</span>\)</span></p> <p>where <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((\alpha)\)</span>\)</span> and <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((\beta)\)</span>\)</span> are complex numbers that define the probability amplitudes of measuring the qubit in state 0 or state 1.</p> <p><strong>The Key Points:</strong> - <strong>Superposition</strong>: A qubit can be in a combination of both states at once, unlike classical bits that are always in one state. - <strong>Measurement</strong>: When you measure a qubit, it "collapses" into one of the two possible states (0 or 1), with probabilities determined by the coefficients <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((\alpha)\)</span>\)</span> and <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((\beta)\)</span>\)</span>. Before measurement, however, it truly exists in both states. - <strong>Interference</strong>: This simultaneous existence of both states can lead to <strong>quantum interference</strong>, which is exploited in quantum computing algorithms to solve certain problems faster than classical computers.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> Think of a coin spinning in the air. While it's spinning, it's not strictly heads or tails, but a mixture of both. Only when the coin lands (which is like measurement) do you know whether it’s heads or tails.</p> <p>Similarly, a qubit can represent a state that is "both 0 and 1" until you measure it, at which point it will collapse into one of the two states, just like the coin lands on heads or tails.</p> <h2 id=there-is-fault-in-coin-in-air-analogy>There is fault in "coin in air" analogy.<a class=headerlink href=#there-is-fault-in-coin-in-air-analogy title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>In your example of the coin at any point of time when coin is in the air by taking the photograph with a high frame rate camera we know whether coin is had a tail at that time so it is not correct to say that it is in both the position.</p> <p>When you spin a coin, it is indeed in a specific state at any given moment—either heads or tails—though we may not know that state until we measure it by looking at it. A high-frame-rate camera could capture that exact moment and reveal whether the coin is closer to heads or tails, but the coin is never in both states simultaneously in the classical sense.</p> <p>So, the coin example is not a perfect analogy for quantum superposition, as the coin only takes one state (heads or tails) at any moment, regardless of whether we observe it. It’s just that we don't know the state until we observe it.</p> <p>Superposition is not about "both states at once" in a physical sense; it’s a deeper probabilistic reality unique to quantum systems.</p> <h2 id=what-are-the-foundations-of-quantum-physics>What are the foundations of quantum physics?<a class=headerlink href=#what-are-the-foundations-of-quantum-physics title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The foundations of quantum physics reveal a universe that is fundamentally different from our everyday classical experiences. Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic realm with principles like superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty, enabling groundbreaking technologies while challenging our understanding of reality. The foundations of quantum physics are the fundamental principles, concepts, and theories that describe the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.

Let's break it down step by step:</p> <h3 id=1-structure-of-a-conductor><strong>1. Structure of a Conductor</strong><a class=headerlink href=#1-structure-of-a-conductor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>While atoms are indeed mostly empty space, they still have a <strong>nucleus</strong> (made up of protons and neutrons) and <strong>electrons</strong> surrounding them in <strong>electron clouds</strong>. The electrons in a conductor, like copper or aluminum, are <strong>delocalized</strong>—meaning they are not tightly bound to a specific atom. These <strong>free electrons</strong> form what's called the <strong>electron sea</strong>, and they can move through the material (this is the electrical current).</p> <p>Even though the atoms themselves are mostly empty space, the <strong>nucleus</strong> and the <strong>electron cloud</strong> still exert forces on the moving electrons.</p> <h3 id=2-collisions-with-atoms><strong>2. Collisions with Atoms</strong><a class=headerlink href=#2-collisions-with-atoms title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>When an electron moves through a conductor, it's not like it's traveling through an empty vacuum. The electrons in the material constantly interact with the atomic nuclei and the other <strong>delocalized electrons</strong>. These interactions are primarily of two types:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Electron-Atom Collisions</strong>: The moving free electrons can collide with the positively charged atomic nuclei (or ions) in the material. While atoms are mostly empty space, the <strong>nucleus</strong> is dense and carries a positive charge, and the <strong>electron cloud</strong> can exert forces on the moving electrons as well. </li> <li> <p>When the electron collides with these nuclei, it can <strong>lose some energy</strong> in the process. This is because the collision transfers some of the electron's energy to the atomic lattice (the structure of atoms in the material), causing the atoms to vibrate more (this is what we perceive as <strong>heat</strong>).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electron-Electron Interactions</strong>: Electrons moving through the conductor can also interact with other <strong>free electrons</strong> in the material. These interactions can also cause the electron to scatter, losing some of its momentum and energy.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id=3-what-happens-during-the-collision><strong>3. What Happens During the Collision?</strong><a class=headerlink href=#3-what-happens-during-the-collision title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>When the electron collides with an atom (or ion) in the conductor, it doesn't completely "stop" or lose all its energy. Instead, it loses some of its kinetic energy and <strong>changes direction</strong>. This process is <strong>scattering</strong>, and it’s a key reason why conductors have <strong>resistance</strong>.</p> <p>The energy lost by the electron during a collision: - Increases the <strong>vibration of atoms</strong> in the conductor (which corresponds to an increase in temperature). - Slows down the electron’s movement slightly (since it loses some energy).</p> <p>This resistance to the flow of electrons is what gives rise to the phenomenon we call <strong>electrical resistance</strong> in materials.</p> <h3 id=4-why-doesnt-the-electron-go-straight-through><strong>4. Why Doesn’t the Electron Go Straight Through?</strong><a class=headerlink href=#4-why-doesnt-the-electron-go-straight-through title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>Even though the atom itself is mostly empty space, the <strong>electron cloud</strong> and <strong>nucleus</strong> interact with the moving electron. Electrons are negatively charged, and the <strong>positively charged nucleus</strong> can create a <strong>force field</strong> that repels or attracts the moving electron, causing it to scatter. </p> <p>In quantum mechanics, electrons don’t travel in neat, straight lines; their positions and momenta are uncertain, and they behave like <strong>waves</strong>. The <strong>wave nature</strong> of the electron also means that when it encounters the atomic lattice, it is likely to be scattered in different directions, further slowing down the movement.</p> <h3 id=5-effect-of-temperature-on-collisions><strong>5. Effect of Temperature on Collisions</strong><a class=headerlink href=#5-effect-of-temperature-on-collisions title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The temperature of the conductor also plays a role. At higher temperatures, the <strong>atoms in the conductor vibrate more</strong> due to increased thermal energy, which leads to more frequent collisions between the free electrons and the atoms. This is why <strong>resistance</strong> increases with temperature: more collisions = more energy loss.</p> <h3 id=6-a-simple-analogy><strong>6. A Simple Analogy</strong><a class=headerlink href=#6-a-simple-analogy title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>Imagine you're in a crowded room, walking through a group of people. While most of the room might be "empty" space, you still bump into people, and your movement gets slowed down. The more crowded the room (or the higher the temperature), the more often you bump into people, and the slower you move.</p> <p>Similarly, an electron moving through a conductor is like a person moving through a crowded room of atoms. The more it "bumps into" the atoms, the more energy it loses, and the harder it is for the electron to move smoothly.</p> <h3 id=summary_4><strong>Summary</strong><a class=headerlink href=#summary_4 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Atoms</strong> in a conductor may be small, but they still <strong>exert forces</strong> on moving electrons due to their <strong>nucleus</strong> and <strong>electron cloud</strong>.</li> <li>Electrons in conductors interact with these atoms through <strong>collisions</strong>, leading to energy loss in the form of heat.</li> <li>This energy loss is what gives rise to <strong>electrical resistance</strong>, and it’s also why electrons don’t move in straight lines but instead get scattered and lose energy.</li> </ul> <h2 id=why-electrons-are-negatively-charged>Why electrons are negatively charged?<a class=headerlink href=#why-electrons-are-negatively-charged title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>You said "Electrons are negatively charged," Why do you say it is negative charged, who not to say it is positive charged?

In this experiment, Millikan measured the <strong>force</strong> on tiny oil droplets suspended between two charged plates. Here's a brief overview of the experiment:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Millikan's Setup</strong>: He sprayed tiny droplets of oil between two parallel charged plates. He adjusted the electric field between the plates to suspend individual droplets in mid-air (in equilibrium), balancing the force due to gravity with the force due to the electric field.</li> <li><strong>The Key Idea</strong>: The oil droplets were negatively charged (due to friction), and by adjusting the electric field, Millikan could precisely determine the <strong>charge on individual droplets</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: By carefully measuring the <strong>velocity</strong> of oil droplets in different positions and the strength of the applied electric field, he was able to determine the <strong>discrete charges</strong> on the droplets.</li> </ul> <h4 id=2-key-finding>2. <strong>Key Finding:</strong><a class=headerlink href=#2-key-finding title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <ul> <li>Millikan observed that the <strong>charges on the droplets</strong> were always <strong>multiples of a smallest unit</strong>.

The balance of forces acting on the droplets allowed for an extremely accurate determination of the charge, and by observing that the charges were quantized (appeared in whole multiples of a single value), he concluded that this was the <strong>fundamental unit of electric charge</strong>, which we now call the <strong>elementary charge</strong>.</li> </ul> <h4 id=4-modern-refinements>4. <strong>Modern Refinements:</strong><a class=headerlink href=#4-modern-refinements title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <ul> <li>Since Millikan’s time, scientists have refined the methods used to measure the charge of the electron, but his experiment was the most direct and influential.

You've touched upon some fascinating and deep concepts from modern physics. Let's break down the ideas you're raising:</p> <h3 id=1-conservation-of-energy-and-matter><strong>1. Conservation of Energy and Matter</strong><a class=headerlink href=#1-conservation-of-energy-and-matter title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The <strong>law of conservation of energy</strong> states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. However, this principle holds within the <strong>known systems</strong> and <strong>classical physics</strong>. It applies well to most everyday situations.</p> <p>However, <strong>Einstein’s theory of relativity</strong> (specifically the equation <strong>E = mc²</strong>) tells us that energy and matter are <strong>interchangeable</strong>. This is a revolutionary concept that goes beyond the classical understanding of energy conservation.</p> <h3 id=2-matter-and-energy-equivalence-e-mc2><strong>2. Matter and Energy Equivalence (E = mc²)</strong><a class=headerlink href=#2-matter-and-energy-equivalence-e-mc2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>In the equation <strong>E = mc²</strong>, <strong>E</strong> represents energy, <strong>m</strong> represents mass, and <strong>c</strong> represents the speed of light. This shows that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Essentially, <strong>mass can be converted into energy</strong>, and <strong>energy can be converted into mass</strong>.</p> <h4 id=examples-of-energy-matter-interconversion><strong>Examples of Energy-Matter Interconversion:</strong><a class=headerlink href=#examples-of-energy-matter-interconversion title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>When matter is destroyed (like in particle-antiparticle annihilation)</strong>, the mass of the particles is converted into <strong>pure energy</strong> in the form of <strong>gamma rays</strong> (high-energy photons). This is a real-world example of energy being "created" from matter, as the mass of the matter is transformed into energy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>When energy condenses into matter</strong>, this is typically seen in high-energy processes like <strong>pair production</strong>. For example, when high-energy photons (gamma rays) interact with a strong electromagnetic field, they can produce a particle-antiparticle pair (such as an electron and a positron). This is how energy can be converted into matter, as the energy of the photons becomes the mass of the particles.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Thus, while <strong>energy</strong> cannot simply "disappear" or be "created from nothing," <strong>matter can indeed be converted to energy</strong> and vice versa. This transformation process is fundamental to understanding the <strong>universe</strong> at both <strong>cosmological scales</strong> (like stars, supernovae, and black holes) and <strong>microscopic scales</strong> (like particle collisions).</p> <h3 id=3-destroying-matter-and-creating-energy><strong>3. "Destroying Matter" and Creating Energy</strong><a class=headerlink href=#3-destroying-matter-and-creating-energy title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>When matter is destroyed or converted, as in <strong>nuclear reactions</strong> (fission or fusion), the energy released is far greater than what you would expect from chemical reactions. This is because the mass of the matter is not entirely destroyed; part of it is converted into energy, as explained by <strong>E = mc²</strong>.</p> <p>For instance, in the <strong>sun</strong>, hydrogen atoms undergo <strong>fusion</strong> to form helium, and in the process, a small amount of mass is lost and converted into energy (in the form of light and heat). This is a direct example of <strong>energy being released by converting mass</strong> into energy.</p> <h3 id=4-condensing-energy-to-create-matter><strong>4. "Condensing Energy to Create Matter"</strong><a class=headerlink href=#4-condensing-energy-to-create-matter title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>Yes, in the right conditions, energy can <strong>condense</strong> into matter. One of the most famous instances of this is the <strong>Big Bang</strong>, where immense amounts of energy condensed to form the matter of the universe. More commonly, <strong>pair production</strong> is a quantum process where energy (such as high-energy photons) converts into a particle-antiparticle pair. </p> <h4 id=how-it-works><strong>How it Works:</strong><a class=headerlink href=#how-it-works title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <ul> <li> <p>In <strong>pair production</strong>, a photon with enough energy (greater than 1.022 MeV, the combined mass-energy of an electron and a positron) can transform into an electron and a positron (which is the antimatter counterpart of the electron). The photon’s energy is effectively <strong>converted into mass</strong> in the form of two particles.</p> </li> <li> <p>This process occurs only under certain conditions (such as in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field), because the energy needs to be <strong>sufficient</strong> to create the rest mass of the particles.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id=5-the-role-of-energy-in-creating-matter><strong>5. The Role of Energy in Creating Matter:</strong><a class=headerlink href=#5-the-role-of-energy-in-creating-matter title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>In <strong>high-energy physics</strong> (like in particle accelerators), scientists can create new particles by <strong>colliding high-energy particles</strong> (such as protons) together. The energy of the collision is sometimes enough to create new particles, showing that energy can indeed be converted into matter.</p> <p>For example, when two protons collide at very high speeds in a particle accelerator (like the <strong>Large Hadron Collider</strong>), the kinetic energy of the protons can convert into various new particles (like <strong>Higgs bosons</strong> or other exotic particles). This shows that <strong>energy is not only conserved but can create new matter</strong> under the right conditions.</p> <h3 id=summary-of-key-concepts><strong>Summary of Key Concepts:</strong><a class=headerlink href=#summary-of-key-concepts title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Energy conservation</strong> holds true in classical physics, where energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted.</li> <li><strong>Matter and energy are interchangeable</strong>—as expressed by <strong>E = mc²</strong>—and under certain conditions, energy can be converted into matter and vice versa.</li> <li><strong>Destruction of matter</strong> (such as in particle-antiparticle annihilation) <strong>creates energy</strong>, while <strong>energy condensing into matter</strong> happens in processes like pair production or particle collisions.</li> </ul> <h2 id=how-come-massless-gives-rise-to-mass>How come massless gives rise to mass?<a class=headerlink href=#how-come-massless-gives-rise-to-mass title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>You said "This is how energy can be converted into matter, as the energy of the photons becomes the mass of the particles." <br> It means massless photon give rise to a mass particle.</p> <p>Yes, that's correct!

For example, it can create an <strong>electron</strong> and a <strong>positron</strong>, which are massive particles.</p> <p>The key to understanding this is that the <strong>energy of the photon</strong> (E) gets converted into <strong>mass</strong> (m) of the particles.

The key issue is that, in quantum mechanics, we <strong>cannot precisely describe</strong> the electron's position at any given moment in time, until we make a measurement.

The <strong>probability distribution</strong> (which comes from the wavefunction) tells us where we are likely to find the electron when we measure it. This means that, before measuring, the electron is <strong>not at a single point</strong>. Instead, it exists in a state of <strong>probability</strong>, spread out over a region of space.</li> <li> <p>If you imagine an electron in a cubic meter box, and the electron starts at one corner (let’s assume this is at time <code>t = 0</code>), the wavefunction at <code>t = 1 ns</code> will describe a <strong>probability distribution</strong> that indicates how likely the electron is to be found at different positions within the box at that moment.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>How does the Electron "Travel"?</strong>:</p> </li> <li>According to quantum mechanics, <strong>before measurement</strong>, we cannot think of the electron as traveling along a definite path like a classical object. Instead, it exists as a "probability cloud." Its wavefunction spreads out over time, meaning the electron has a probability of being found in various locations in space, but we cannot say with certainty where it is.</li> <li> <p><strong>If we did measure its position</strong> at <code>t = 1 ns</code>, the electron would <strong>collapse</strong> to a specific point in the box. The measurement forces the system to "choose" a specific location. But <strong>before the measurement</strong>, we only have probabilities. The wavefunction will give us a range of possible positions for the electron, but it won't tell us its precise location.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>What Happens After 1 ns?</strong>:</p> </li> <li>If the electron is in free space (not interacting with anything), its wavefunction will evolve according to the <strong>Schrödinger equation</strong>. The wavefunction will spread out, meaning the electron has a <strong>greater probability</strong> of being found at different places in the box after 1 ns. It could be closer to the other end of the box, or it could still be near the starting point. We cannot know exactly where it is, only the probabilities of where it could be found when we measure.</li> <li> <p>The <strong>spread</strong> of the wavefunction will depend on the <strong>momentum</strong> and <strong>energy</strong> of the electron. If the electron has a high momentum (fast speed), its wavefunction will spread out less over time, and the electron is more likely to be found closer to its initial position. If the electron has low momentum (moves slowly), its wavefunction will spread out more, and it could be found anywhere in the box.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>The Concept of "Path" and Measurement</strong>:</p> </li> <li>Unlike classical particles (like a baseball or a car), which follow <strong>definite paths</strong> through space, quantum particles like electrons do not have a clear, definite path until they are measured. They exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of all possible paths.</li> <li>When you measure the electron's position, the superposition collapses, and you get a specific location. This process is known as <strong>wavefunction collapse</strong>. But <strong>before the measurement</strong>, the electron doesn't have a definite location—it only has a <strong>probability of being in different places</strong>.</li> </ol> <h3 id=example-in-a-1-cubic-meter-box>Example in a 1 Cubic Meter Box:<a class=headerlink href=#example-in-a-1-cubic-meter-box title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>Let’s say an electron is emitted from a corner of a 1 cubic meter box, and we want to know where it might be after 1 ns. Here's how we would think about it:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Step 1: Initial Wavefunction</strong>: When the electron is emitted, it has a wavefunction that might be sharply concentrated at the corner (the initial location), but over time, this wavefunction spreads out. The more time that passes, the more the wavefunction spreads.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 2: Probability Distribution at 1 ns</strong>: After 1 ns, the wavefunction describes the <strong>probability</strong> of finding the electron at any given point in the box. The electron could be anywhere, but we would have a higher probability of finding it near the starting point if it is moving slowly. If it's moving faster, the wavefunction might spread out more evenly across the box.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Step 3: Collapse upon Measurement</strong>: If you measure the electron's position at <code>t = 1 ns</code>, the wavefunction collapses, and the electron will be found at a specific point in the box. The position is random but governed by the probability distribution. So, if the wavefunction indicates a higher probability of the electron being near one side of the box, it’s more likely to be found there, but there is always some chance of finding it in other places.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id=why-cant-we-know-the-exact-location-of-the-electron>Why Can't We Know the Exact Location of the Electron?<a class=headerlink href=#why-cant-we-know-the-exact-location-of-the-electron title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The electron doesn’t have a "definite" position unless we measure it. This is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and is a direct result of <strong>Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle</strong>. According to this principle, we cannot simultaneously know both the <strong>exact position</strong> and <strong>exact momentum</strong> of a particle like an electron. The more precisely we try to measure one, the less precisely we can know the other.</p> <p>In your scenario:</p> <ul> <li>If we try to track the <strong>exact position</strong> of the electron after 1 ns, the uncertainty in its momentum (and therefore its velocity) will increase.

Classical Expectation</strong><a class=headerlink href=#1-classical-expectation title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>In classical physics: - If you aim the electron straight downward, it should follow a predictable trajectory based on its initial velocity and energy. - You would not expect it to end up on the extreme left or right unless some external force (like an electric or magnetic field) acted on it to deflect its path.</p> <h3 id=2-quantum-mechanical-possibility><strong>2. Quantum Mechanical Possibility</strong><a class=headerlink href=#2-quantum-mechanical-possibility title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>In quantum mechanics: - The electron’s wavefunction spreads out as it travels. This spread introduces a <strong>probability</strong> of finding the electron in locations other than its expected classical trajectory. - Even if the initial wavefunction is sharply peaked toward a downward direction, it has some non-zero probability of being detected on the left or right sides of the box due to the <strong>uncertainty principle</strong> and <strong>wavefunction evolution</strong>.</p> <h3 id=3-factors-influencing-the-outcome><strong>3.

Real-World Outcome</strong><a class=headerlink href=#4-real-world-outcome title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>In most practical scenarios: - The electron will be detected close to its expected downward trajectory, as the probability of extreme left or right locations will be incredibly small. - Quantum effects like wavefunction spreading are real but are dominated by the electron’s high energy and directional momentum.</p> <h3 id=5-analogies><strong>5.

The probability density is:</p> <p>$$ P(\mathbf{r}, t) = |\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)|^2 $$</p> <p>Here’s how we analyze it step by step:</p> <h3 id=wavefunction-of-the-photon-in-3d>Wavefunction of the Photon in 3D<a class=headerlink href=#wavefunction-of-the-photon-in-3d title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>For a photon with a wavelength of <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \lambda = 500 \, \text{nm} )\)</span>\)</span> traveling in the direction of the wavevector <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \mathbf{k} )\)</span>\)</span>, the wavefunction in 3D space is:</p> <p>$$ \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = A e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)} $$</p> <ul> <li><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \mathbf{k} )\)</span>\)</span>: wavevector <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \|\mathbf{k}\| = 2\pi / \lambda )\)</span>\)</span>, direction of travel).</li> <li><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \mathbf{r} )\)</span>\)</span>: position vector in 3D <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) )\)</span>\)</span>.</li> <li><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( \omega = c \|\mathbf{k}\| )\)</span>\)</span>: angular frequency.</li> <li><span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\(( A )\)</span>\)</span>: normalization constant.</li> </ul> <h3 id=probability-density-function>Probability Density Function<a class=headerlink href=#probability-density-function title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The probability density is the squared magnitude of the wavefunction:</p> <div class=arithmatex>\[ P(\mathbf{r}, t) = \|\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\|^2 = \|A\|^2 \]</div> <p>This means: 1. The photon’s wavefunction has <strong>uniform intensity</strong> across space. 2.

To know all this radius I don't need probablity distribution function and wave function. how to use these function then? You’re absolutely correct that the <strong>radius</strong> <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((r = ct)\)</span>\)</span> (distance the photon travels in time <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((t)\)</span>\)</span> can be calculated from simple classical reasoning based on the speed of light. The <strong>wavefunction</strong> and <strong>probability density function</strong>, however, offer much deeper insights that go beyond just calculating the distance. Let’s explore their purpose and utility:</p> <h3 id=1-why-use-the-wavefunction>1. <strong>Why Use the Wavefunction?</strong><a class=headerlink href=#1-why-use-the-wavefunction title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The wavefunction is not just about distance or motion. It encodes the <strong>quantum nature</strong> of the particle, such as: - <strong>Interference effects</strong>: In scenarios like the double-slit experiment, the wavefunction describes how the photon’s probabilities interfere, producing patterns we observe. - <strong>Localization</strong>: The wavefunction tells us the regions in space where the photon (or particle) is more likely to be found, even when it’s spread out due to quantum uncertainty. - <strong>Interaction probabilities</strong>: When the photon interacts with other particles (like being detected by a sensor or scattered), the wavefunction helps predict <strong>how likely the photon is to interact in certain regions</strong>.</p> <h3 id=2-how-to-use-the-wavefunction-and-probability-density>2. <strong>How to Use the Wavefunction and Probability Density</strong><a class=headerlink href=#2-how-to-use-the-wavefunction-and-probability-density title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>To see their practical utility, let’s consider a few examples:</p> <h4 id=example-1-single-photon-in-an-experiment><strong>Example 1: Single Photon in an Experiment</strong><a class=headerlink href=#example-1-single-photon-in-an-experiment title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>Imagine you emit a photon from a source toward a detector. The wavefunction predicts: - The <strong>spatial probability distribution</strong> of where the photon might hit the detector. - If the photon passes through an optical setup (e.g., a slit or lens), the wavefunction can describe how the photon spreads or focuses.</p> <h4 id=example-2-double-slit-experiment><strong>Example 2: Double-Slit Experiment</strong><a class=headerlink href=#example-2-double-slit-experiment title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>If the photon passes through two slits, its wavefunction becomes a <strong>superposition of two paths</strong>: $$ \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \psi_1(\mathbf{r}, t) + \psi_2(\mathbf{r}, t) $$ Here: - <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((\|\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\|^2)\)</span>\)</span> gives the <strong>interference pattern</strong> on the detection screen. - The pattern can’t be explained using classical reasoning, as it arises from the photon’s quantum wave nature.</p> <h4 id=example-3-localization-after-measurement><strong>Example 3: Localization After Measurement</strong><a class=headerlink href=#example-3-localization-after-measurement title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>If the wavefunction was initially a <strong>plane wave</strong> (spread out infinitely), after a measurement, the wavefunction <strong>collapses</strong> to a localized state. The probability density tells us where the photon is most likely to be detected.</p> <h3 id=3-when-does-the-wavefunction-become-essential>3. <strong>When Does the Wavefunction Become Essential?</strong><a class=headerlink href=#3-when-does-the-wavefunction-become-essential title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The wavefunction is crucial in scenarios where classical concepts like "path" or "location" fail: - <strong>Quantum Tunneling</strong>: The probability density predicts the chance of a particle appearing on the other side of a barrier it classically couldn’t cross. - <strong>Quantum Optics</strong>: Wavefunctions describe how photons interact in quantum systems like beam splitters or entangled states. - <strong>Scattering and Absorption</strong>: Wavefunctions predict how particles scatter off or are absorbed by matter.</p> <h3 id=4-using-the-wavefunction-in-your-example>4. <strong>Using the Wavefunction in Your Example</strong><a class=headerlink href=#4-using-the-wavefunction-in-your-example title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>For a photon moving through space: 1. <strong>Without obstacles</strong>: The photon’s wavefunction is a plane wave, and the probability density is uniform on the sphere of radius <span class=arithmatex>\(<span class=arithmatex>\((r = ct)\)</span>\)</span>. 2. <strong>With obstacles</strong> (e.g., a slit or scattering object): The wavefunction becomes more complex, describing how the photon diffracts, scatters, or interferes.</p> <h3 id=why-all-the-math>Why All the Math?<a class=headerlink href=#why-all-the-math title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The wavefunction and probability density are tools to: 1. Predict outcomes of quantum experiments. 2. Understand quantum behaviors like superposition, interference, and entanglement. 3. Model interactions with other particles or systems.</p> <p>In simple cases (like your photon example), classical reasoning might suffice. But in more complex quantum scenarios, the wavefunction is indispensable!</p> </article> </div> <script>var target=document.getElementById(location.hash.slice(1));target&&target.name&&(target.checked=target.name.startsWith("__tabbed_"))</script> </div> <button type=button class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8z"/></svg> Back to top </button> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright &copy;
